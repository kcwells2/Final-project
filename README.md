The World Series this year between the Astros and Dodgers was one of the exciting World Series of all time resulting in the Houston Astros winning their first World Series of all time. The red hot Houston offense was facing the lights out Dodger pitching which meant one would have to break. My using Monte Carlo simulation focuses on the expected runs scored for both the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers to see if the correct team won

### Hypothesis before running the simulation: 
Houston Astros deserves to win the World Series.

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty

For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
