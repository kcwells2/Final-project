# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
