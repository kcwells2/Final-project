# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose: The World Series this year between the Astros and Dodgers was one of the exciting World Series of all time resulting in the Houston Astros winning their first World Series of all time. The red hot Houston offense was facing the lights out Dodger pitching which meant one would have to break. My using Monte Carlo Sinulation is focused on this project was focusing on did the right team win the world series.

### Hypothesis before running the simulation: Houston Astros deserves to win the World Series

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
